# solidworks-device
This device was made using solidworks. It separates two types of tiles with the help of a laser distance sensor. The tiles go through two conveyor belts powered by two electromotors. The first conveyor belts has less power and it is more wide, because more tiles are needed to fit in the space for certain period of time. Then the more powerful second electro motor attached to the second conveyor belt in a sort of a snatching style, grabs and carries the tiles that come onto it. Because the speed and narrow space the tiles go one by one in the boxes separated by the sensor.
